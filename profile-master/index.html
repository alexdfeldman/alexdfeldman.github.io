      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Alex went to undergrad at the University of Michigan where he attended the Ross Shool of Business and graduated in 2007 with a BBA in Finance and Accounting.  He then moved to New York City and traded natural gas options for five years before realizing his life was hell and he contributed nothing to society. He then enrolled at Kellogg in the fall of 2013 with plans to major in Finance and Entrepreneurship.  Alex spent his summer in between his first and second years as a Business Development intern at Twitter in San Francisco.
